TODO:
    - Decide if image is T1 or T2 using TR and TE.
    - Remove all .DS_STORE files and add it to .gitignore.
    - NEED to make sure that session ID is either included or excluded, but cannot be inconsistent.
    - Add option to use dcm2nii to image conversion function.
    - Add (hidden) log file directory and .bidsignore file
    - Add simpler example configurations file
    - Add file handling capabilities of task csv/tsv files
        - use BIDSimg class to keep track of files
            or
        - create new class
    - Add option for creating sessions TSV file(s)
